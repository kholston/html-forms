#  Project: HTML FORMS

In this project, you’ll get a chance to rebuild the form used by Mint.com for signing up new users. They have been highly praised for the design and simplicity of their site, and their signup process is very clean. If the link isn’t working for you, an alternative form to rebuild is by Mailchimp.com.
